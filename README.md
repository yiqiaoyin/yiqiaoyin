# Yin's Profile:

## Brief
Yiqiao have been in the AI/ML space since 2015, leading all forms of AI-backed solutions including but not limited to Computer Vision, Natural Language Models (NLP), and most recently Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI. He is currently a Tech Lead at <a href="https://www.vertexinc.com/">Vertex Inc</a>, a global leading provider of tax technologies üìäüíª. Previously, he was a Senior ML Engineer at an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">S&P 500</a> company, <a href="https://www.labcorp.com/">LabCorp</a>, developing AI-driven solutions üß†üíª in drug diagnostics, drug development, operations management, and financial decisions for our global leaders in life sciences üåçüî¨ (see Labcorp SEC filings <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=920148&owner=exclude">here</a>). He has also held positions such as enterprise-level Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/agriculture">Bayer</a> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURO_STOXX_50">EURO STOXX 50</a> company), Quantitative Researcher (apprenticeship) at <a href="https://www.aqr.com/">AQR</a> (a global hedge fund pioneering in alternative quantitative strategies to portfolio management and <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/investment-ideas/what-is-factor-investing">factor-based trading</a>), and Equity Trader at <a href="https://t3trading.com/">T3 Trading</a> on Wall Street (where he was briefly licensed <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/6338834">Series 56</a> by <a href="https://www.finra.org/">FINRA</a>). He supervises a small fund specializing in algorithmic trading (since 2011, performance is <a href="https://yinscapital.com/letters/">here</a>) in equity market, cryptocurrencies, and real estate investment. He also runs his own monetized <a href="https://youtube.com/YiqiaoYin/">YouTube Channel</a>. Feel free to add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiqiaoyin/">LinkedIn</a>. üöÄüìà

Though he started in Finance, Yin's AI career started from academic environment. He was a PhD student in [Statistics at Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu/) from September of 2020 to December of 2021 üìàüéì. He earned a B.A. in Mathematics, and an [M.S. in Finance](https://simon.rochester.edu/programs/full-time-ms-in-finance) from [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) üíºüìä. His research interests are wide-ranging in [representation learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning), including Feature Learning, [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), [Computer Vision (CV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), and [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) ü§ñüëÄ. Additionally, he has some prior research experience in [Financial Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics) and [Asset Pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_pricing) üíπüìâ.

When Yiqiao was in PhD program at Columbia University, he investigated heavily in a domain known as dimension reduction and he focused on developing tools for scientists to understand the important features that affect the prediction outcome. He has multiple papers published on the topic known as I-score or Influence Score (Influence Measure) that is a non-parametric dimension reduction technique on supervised learning. The work gave him the foundation of statistical machine learning and experience of conducting independent research.

### View about stock market:
Yiqiao believed that stock market is mostly fairly efficient. Many research groups and companies are doing great things out there with advanced tools. However, market does get "noisy" once in a while and that breeds opportunity. Yiqiao personally trades off a momentum strategy and he has his own market timing algorithm. This app [https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/technical-trader](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/technical-trader) demonstrates how Yiqiao times the entry point should he decides to enter a stock. This app [https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/Momentum-Strategy-Screener](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/Momentum-Strategy-Screener) demonstrates how Yiqiao weighs the stocks in his portfolio.

### View about AI:
Yiqiao has good faith in today's advancement of AI technology and is a big supporter of AI-backed technology to boost business operation and enhance corporate strategy. Many clients and companies Yiqiao worked with in the past led him to conclude that 'AI alone may falter and stray, but built around a corporate strategy, it paves the way.'
